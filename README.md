# üìä Sales and Customer Analytics Using Power BI

## üìåProject Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer data to uncover key insights into business performance, customer behavior, and regional sales trends. The goal of the project was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence using Microsoft Power BI.
The analysis provides a holistic view of sales performance, profitability, customer churn, and product trends, empowering decision-makers to identify growth opportunities, improve retention, and optimize sales strategies.
The Power BI solution was designed as a two-part dashboard system ‚Äî one focused on Sales Performance, and the other on Customer and Logistics Analytics.

The second dashboard focuses on understanding customer behavior, churn patterns, and logistics performance to help the company improve customer retention and optimize delivery strategies.


## ‚ö†Ô∏èProblem Statement

Businesses often face challenges in monitoring sales performance, understanding customer behavior, and identifying areas for improvement. This project aims to address these questions:

1. What are the major drivers of total sales and profit across regions and product categories?

2. Which regions and customer segments contribute the most to overall performance?

3. What factors influence customer churn, and how can retention be improved?

4. How do logistics and returns impact profitability?




## üß±Data Structure

The dataset contains detailed information on sales transactions, customer profiles, products, and logistics. Key fields include:

- Sales Data: Order ID, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount, Category, Subcategory

- Customer Data: Customer ID, Customer Name, Region, Country, City

- Logistics Data: Ship Mode, Order Date, Ship Date, Delivery Time

- Churn Data: Customer Status (Active or Churned), Customer Lifetime Value

- A relational data model was built in Power BI, connecting all these tables to allow seamless cross-analysis.

## ‚ú®Key Features

- Trend Analysis: A line chart visualizes sales over time to track year-over-year growth and seasonality.

## üõ†Ô∏èMethodology

The entire analysis was conducted in Power BI, leveraging its data modeling and visualization capabilities.

- Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Imported raw data into Power BI using Power Query Editor.

- Cleaned and transformed data by removing duplicates, correcting data types, and handling missing values.


### Data Modeling

### DAX Calculations

- Created custom DAX measures such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin, Total Orders, Customer Lifetime Value, and Churned Customers for precise KPI tracking.


### Data Visualization and Dashboard Design

- Designed interactive dashboards using Power BI visuals such as bar charts, maps, gauges, and line graphs.

- Added slicers for dynamic filtering by region, category, and customer status.

- Ensured a clear, user-friendly design for effective storytelling and business decision-making.


## üìàKey Insights and Findings

1. Regional Performance: Certain regions consistently outperform others in total sales and profit, indicating strong market potential and customer base concentration.

2. ustomer Churn: Geographic analysis revealed cities and regions with higher churn rates, signaling areas needing customer relationship improvements.

3. Product Category Trends: Specific product categories drive a significant portion of total sales, highlighting areas for inventory and marketing focus.

4. Profitability Patterns: Profit margins vary across regions and categories, suggesting opportunities for pricing or cost-optimization strategies.
